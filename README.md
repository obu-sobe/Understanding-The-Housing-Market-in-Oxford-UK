# Understanding The Housing Market in Oxfordshire, UK? What Matters Most to Home-Buyers.

This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings measured by Energy Efficiency Certificates (EPCs) affect selling prices of residential properties in Oxfordshire. The study involves 84846 dwellings sold at least twice between the year 1995 to 2020. When applying hedonic regression in the first part of this study, the estimations show a non-linear pattern between the energy efficiency rate and the dwellingâ€™s total price. The results also show that whilst there are evidences of a significant positive relationship between EPC rating and detached, semi-detached, terraced and flats , there is an inverse relation between EPC ratting of maisonette dwellings and their price. For the second part of this study on repeat sales regression, the estimations show a smoother relationship between dwellings prices and energy efficiency rating. There are significant, positive, effect of energy efficiency rating on the prices of detached dwellings that are rated A, B, C but a negative effect on the prices of detached dwellings rated E,F,G. According to our study, the overall evaluation of the real-estate market in Oxfordshire suggests that for the majority of dwelling types there is high significant co-relation between energy efficiency rating and the prices, but true for other types of dwellings rated as C band.
